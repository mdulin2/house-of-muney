'''
Launch script for the POC. Can be used for the following: 
- Loading the proper version of LibC and Loader with the POC 
- Easier debugging (in particular, setting breakpoints) 


Mmap LEAKLESS Chunk Overwrites 
;tldr: Rewrite symbol table of LibC to get code execution

Notes: 
- This POC should work on all versions of libc. But, the LibC 
  specific version for this is 2.31. 
- This technique only works if no or partial RELRO is used 
  with a dynamicly linked binary. 
- Full RELRO does not do LAZY dynamic symbol resolution so the technique
  does not work with full relro enabled. 

Steps in the code (POC in munmap_rewrite.c): 
- Buffer overflow (vulnerability) 
- Munmap LibC (.gnu.hash and .dynsym) 
- Allocate over LibC with mmap
- Rewrite string hashing and symbol table
- Pop shell :)
